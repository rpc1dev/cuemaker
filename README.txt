   cuemaker v1.0 - Readme

0. License
GPL version 2.0 or later

1. The Why
Well, both Nero and EAC (Exact Audio Copy) are complete arses when it comes to
supporting cue files. I mean, come on, EAC could generate cue data in a LOGICAL
Nero compatible way, and Nero could be a lot more forgiving about the order of
data in each section. Ego idiots!
So, to take over the pain of having to enter all the CD-Text information, when
it's already present in the audio filenames, I created cuemaker.
It is also super-convenient when you want to create your own compilations.

2. The How
Well, let's say you have the following files in your directory
(And yes, I DO own an original copy of that CD!):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 01 - Amber Waves.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 02 - A Sorta Fairytale.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 03 - Wednesday.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 04 - Strange.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 05 - Carbon.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 06 - Crazy.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 07 - Wampum Prayer.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 08 - Don't Make Me Come To Vegas.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 09 - Sweet Sangria.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 10 - Your Cloud.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 11 - Pancake.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 12 - I Can't See New York.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 13 - Mrs. Jesus.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 14 - Taxi Ride.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 15 - Another Girl's Paradise.flac

Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 17 - Virginia.flac
Tori Amos - Tori Amos  Scarlet's Walk - 18 - Gold Dust.flac
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then, after you copied over cuemaker to that directory, you would use:
  cuemaker "%P - %S  %A - %N - %T" > mycue.cue
And lo and behold, you have generatd the perfect CUE Sheet:

All you have to do then is decompress the FLAC files to WAV and feed the cue
to your favorite CD buring program.

3. Additional comments:
- Remember: PANTS! ([P]erformer, [A]lbum title, track [N]umber, track [T]itle or
  [S]uppress)
- "Redirection: it's more powerful than you!"
  Why would I waste my time asking for an output filename, when you can simply
  redirect? By the way, anything that's non cue data goes to stderr, and will
  NOT be redirected.
- Option -g will add a 2 seconds pregap on all tracks. And no, I have no plans
  to add an option to modify the pregap time for OBVIOUS reasons.
  And before you ask, there is ALWAYS a 2 seconds pregap before the first track.
  It's the specs, and if it's not in the cue sheet, most CD burning apps will add
  it anyway, so I will darn well add it by default!
- Automatic track numbers will be generated if none are present in the filenames
- The performer given with -p overrides the Album Performer but NOT the Track
  Performer(s), again for obvious reasons.
  If you really want to override Track Performers, just suppress it with option
  %S
- Additional matching pattern options %d (repetition of digits) and %w
  (repetition of word characters, i.e [a-zA-Z0-9_]) can be used to SUPPRESS data
  All other patterns resolve to Perl's '(.*)'
- Supported extensions are flac, ape, wav, mp3
- This is a VC++ Executable compressed with UPX.

4. Dependencies and thanks:
- PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (http://www.pcre.org/)
  You need the pcre library to recompile. This was compiled with the static
  version (provided)
